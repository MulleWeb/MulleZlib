"in the second division 2. Oberliga West in 1949, while Preußen Bochum went "
"on to lower tier amateur level play. VfL captured the division title in 1953 "
"to advance to the Oberliga West for a single season. They repeated their"
"divisional win in 1956 and returned to the top-flight until again being "

"With the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional league, in "
"1963 VfL found itself in the third tier Amateurliga Westfalen. A first-place "
"result there in 1965 raised them to the Regionalliga West (II), from which they "
"began a steady climb up the league table to the Bundesliga in 1971. During this "
"rise, Bochum also played its way to the final of the 1967–68 DFB-Pokal, where"
"they lost 1–4 to 1. FC Köln."
""
"In spite of being a perennial lower table side, Bochum developed a reputation"
"for tenaciousness on the field in a run of 20 seasons in the top flight. The "
"club made a repeat appearance in the DFB-Pokal final in 1988, losing 0–1 to "
"Eintracht Frankfurt. Relegated after a 16th-place finish in the 1992–93 season, "
"the team has become a classic \"yo-yo club\", bouncing up and down between the "
"Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. The club's best Bundesliga results have come "
"relatively recently as fifth-place finishes in 1996–97 and 2003–04, which "
"earned them appearances in the UEFA Cup. In 1997, they advanced to the third "
"round, where they were eliminated by Ajax, and in 2004, they were eliminated "
"early through away goals (0–0 and 1–1) by Standard Liege.";
